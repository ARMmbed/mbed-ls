# Development moved: https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-tools

The development of Mbed LS has been moved into the [mbed-os-tools](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-tools/) repository. The [mbed-ls](https://pypi.org/project/mbed-ls/) package is still available on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

If you have any questions or encounter issues, please raise an issue in the [mbed-os-tools](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-tools/) repository.

## Adding platform support

You can still add new platform support, however this should be done in `mbed-os-tools`. For more information, please see [this guide](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-tools/tree/master/legacy/mbed-ls#adding-platform-support).
